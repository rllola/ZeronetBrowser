An attempt to create a dedicated browser for ZeroNet using PyQt5

This browser advantage compare to others is that it is bundle with ZeroNet in it.

It understand zero: url and will soon be filled with others ZeroNet specific features (dev tools, blocking clearnet, zeronet gui commands, app store, Tor out of the box, ...).

## About

This project offer a custom browser with ZeroNet bundle in it.

A custom browser could have several advantages :
- Understanding `zero:` url
- Offering specific dev tool for ZeroNet site development
- Blocking clearnet site or opening them in default browser
- ZeroNet GUI for commands (more user friendly)
- Plugin store ???
- etc...

It can also help non-tech people understanding what is running on the ZeroNet protocol and what is clearnet. The `127.0.0.1:43110` seems to be confusing for people.
